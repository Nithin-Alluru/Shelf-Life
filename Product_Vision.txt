 Do you want to know more about your friends' reading habits? Which genres do they rate harshly? What about authors? What are they saying about their latest read, and which reviews of that book resonated with them the most? Is there an underrated book they enjoyed more than the average reader?

We aim to answer these questions with a socially-focused alternative site for book reviews. You can take a deeper look at the data that represents each individual reader's taste and discover new starting points for conversations with friends and strangers (You gave Ulysses a three?!).
